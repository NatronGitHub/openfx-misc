** About ChannelMath

ChannelMath is an OFX Plugin that allows the user to write simple
math expressions. This plugin is free to use and distribute for any purpose.

** Installation

 Put ChannelMath.ofx.bundle in your OFX plugin path. This is usually:
  /Library/OFX/Plugins
  If that folder doesn't exist, you can create it. Or, if you prefer, use the environment
  variable OFX_PLUGIN_PATH.

** How to Use ChannelMath 

*** Example 1: Monochrome
For a simple grey set these values:
| field | value     |
|-------+-----------|
| expr1 | (r+g+b)/3 |
| red   | expr1     |
| blue  | expr1     |
| green | expr1     |

*** Example 2: Adjust RGB levels
Enter these values:
| field  | value        |
|--------+--------------|
| red    | r * param1.r |
| green  | g * param1.g |
| blue   | b * param1.b |
then use the colour wheel in param1 to adjust your image.

*** Example 3: Luminance Matte
Use luminance for alpha with:
| field | value                                |
|-------+--------------------------------------|
| alpha | 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b |
