===========

Miscellaneous OFX / OpenFX / Open Effects plugins.

These plugins were primarily developped for
[Natron](http://natron.inria.fr), but may be used with other
[OpenFX](http://openeffects.org) hosts.

More information about OpenFX Hosts, OpenFX Plugins (commercial or
free), and OpenFX documentation can be found at
<http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/openfx/>.

Downloads
---------

### Source

To compile openfx-misc from source, see the Installation section below. There is no official source release: the openfx-misc source repository is composed of a stable set of plugins, and new plugins are introduced as beta features until they are considered stable.

### Binaries

Windows binaries compiled with Visual Studio 2017 (which should be compatible with most OpenFX hosts including [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)) are available as part of the [openfx-misc project on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/NatronGitHub/openfx-misc/build/artifacts).

Windows binaries compiled with MinGW MinGW-w64 are available as part of the portable Natron binary distributions for Windows.

Notes & Caveats
---------------

### What does the Roto plugin do?

If you use the Roto plugin in any other host than [Natron](http://natron.inria.fr), you will notice that it doesn't do much. Its role is just to provide an entry point for a host-based rotoscoping tool, which provides a roto mask to this plugin.

### The default parameters are too small on DaVinci Resolve

This is because Resolve does not support the `kOfxParamPropDefaultCoordinateSystem` property. A solution was implemented in CornerPin (look for the comment "Some hosts (e.g. Resolve) may not support normalized defaults"), but the following plugins still have to be fixed:

- CopyRectangle
- Crop
- HSVTool
- ImageStatistics
- ofxsGenerator
- ofxsPositionInteract
- ofxsTransformInteract
- Position
- ReConverge
- TestPosition
- TrackerPM

### ColorLookup does not work on Nuke 8/9, DaVinci Resolve...

Although Nuke 8 & 9 claim via OpenFX that they support parametric parameters (i.e. adjustable parametric curves), these don't work (at least on OS X, and maybe on other platforms). The plugin appears in the plugin list, but cannot be instanciated. Nothing seems to happen, and the following message appears on the console (on OS X):

    Exception thrown
      basic_string::_S_construct NULL not valid

The same happens with other plugins using parametric parameters, such as [TuttleHistogramKeyer](http://www.tuttleofx.org/).

Parametric parameters work in older versions of Nuke (at least in Nuke 6 & 7).

DaVinci Resolve does not support parametric parameters.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/openfx-misc/issues) if you think openfx-misc is doing something wrong, or you know of other hosts which have problems with parametric paremeters.

Although ColorCorrect uses parametric parameters, it can still be instanciated on Nuke 8 & 9 and on DaVinci Resolve, but the curve ranges are not adjustable (shadows are decreasing linearly from 0 to 0.09, and highlights are increasing linearly from 0.5 to 1.0).


### Retime output does not contain motion blur, where is the "box" filter and the "shutter" parameter?

We should take the code from FrameBlend, simplify, and incorporate it in Retime.


Installation
------------

These plugins are included in the binary distributions of [Natron](https://natrongithub.github.io/).

If you want to compile the plugins from source, you may either use the
provided Unix Makefile, the Xcode project, or the Visual Studio project.

### Getting the sources from github

To fetch the latest sources from github, execute the following commands:

	git clone https://github.com/NatronGitHub/openfx-misc.git
	cd openfx-misc
	git submodule update -i -r

In order to get a specific tag, corresponding to a source release, do `git tag -l`
to get the list of tags, and then `git checkout tags/<tag_name>`
to checkout a given tag.

### Unix/Linux/FreeBSD/OS X, using Makefiles

On Unix-like systems, the plugins can be compiled by typing in a
terminal:
- `make [options]` to compile as a single combined plugin (see below
  for valid options).
- `make nomulti [options]` to compile as separate plugins (useful if
only a few plugins are is needed, for example). `make` can also be
executed in any plugin's directory.
- `make [options] CXXFLAGS_ADD=-fopenmp LDFLAGS_ADD=-fopenmp` to compile
  with OpenMP support (available for CImg-based plugins and DenoiseSharpen).

The most common options are `CONFIG=release` to compile a release
version, `CONFIG=debug` to compile a debug version. Or
`CONFIG=relwithdebinfo` to compile an optimized version with debugging
symbols.

Another common option is `BITS=32`for compiling a 32-bits version,
`BITS=64` for a 64-bits version, and `BITS=Universal` for a universal
binary (OS X only).

See the file `Makefile.master`in the toplevel directory for other useful
flags/variables.

The compiled plugins are placed in subdirectories named after the
configuration, for example Linux-64-realease for a 64-bits Linux
compilation. In each of these directories, a `*.bundle` directory is
created, which has to be moved to the proper place
(`/usr/OFX/Plugins`on Linux, or `/Library/OFX/Plugins`on OS X), using
a command like the following, with the *same* options used for
compiling:

	sudo make install [options]

### OS X, using Xcode

The latest version of Xcode should be installed in order to compile this plugin.

Open the "Terminal" application (use spotlight, or browse `/Applications/Utilities`), and paste the following lines one-by-one (an administrator password will be asked for after the second line):

	xcodebuild -configuration Release install
	sudo mkdir /Library/OFX/Plugins
	sudo mv /tmp/Misc.dst/Library/OFX/Plugins/Misc /Library/OFX/Plugins

The plugins may also be compiled by compiling the Xcode project called
`Misc.xcodeproj` in the toplevel directory. The bundles produced by
this project have to be moved to `/Library/OFX/Plugins`.

### MS Windows, using Visual Studio

Compile using the provided `Misc.vcxproj`project found in the `Misc`
directory.

32-bits plugins should be installed in the directory `c:\Program Files
(x86)\Common Files\OFX\Plugin`, 64-bits plugins should be installed in
`c:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX\Plugins`.
